# Family Chores

**Version 0.0.1**

The goal of the project is to develop a rewards system for doing chores.  The house requires a certain level of routine maintenance that has a repeating cycle.  These individual chores are unlocked based on age and are rewarded monetarily for completion.  Each chore has a set amount of core intrisic values and is rewarded primarily on the time it would take an expert (parent) to complete the chore.  If an individual completes a chore in a greater amount of time than alotted, no additional money is rewarded.

Each chore, while having a baseline time amount, also has varying multipliers.  The primary multipliers are the difficulty of the chore, the responsibility of the chore, and the uncomfortableness of the chore.

For example, scooping cat litter has a standard difficulty, standard responsibility, and a 2x multiplier for uncomfortability.
